## What As a Log

- log â€” a series of loosely structured requests, errors, or other messages in a sequence of rotating text files.
- Application logs: meant for humans to read.
- Logs here: for programmatic access.
- Humans reading through many logs is unmanageable and is a tedious exercise to extract meaningful information. So the purpose of logs is to feed into processing systems of queries and graph that can understand behavior across machines.
- Logs in the book: commit log or journal - from database or systems world.
